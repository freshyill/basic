# Basic

Just a basic project starter for the things I tend to do a lot of

## What's in it

* Gulp
* BrowserSync
* Sass with fairly readable errors
* A pretty low-key Bower setup, with only Normalize and jQuery
* A fairly un-opinionated EditorConfig setup

## Installation

    npm install

    bower install

## Running

## Production Mode

    gulp

This will output compressed styles

## Development Mode

    gulp --dev

This will output nested styles

## Todo

* Put a little more effort into the EditorConfig
* Turn this into a Jekyll thing, maybe?
