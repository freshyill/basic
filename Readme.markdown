# Basic

Just a basic project starter for the things I tend to do a lot of

## What's in it

* Gulp
* BrowserSync
* Sass with fairly readable errors
* A pretty low-key Bower setup, with only Normalize and jQuery
* A fairly un-opinionated EditorConfig setup


## Todo

* Set up some Javascript starters
* Put a little more effort into the EditorConfig
* Make sure I'm not forgetting anything with LibSass
* Turn this into a Jekyll thing, maybe?
